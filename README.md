# Start_Print_From_Printer

This repository contains a script that allows you to start prints saved on OctoPrint directly from your printer.

**Note: This script only works with firmware that has LONG_WRITE_SUPPORT!**

Before using the script, please follow the steps below:

1. After installing the script, create a folder named "Folder_name" on your SD card. The name of the folder can be configured in the settings.

## TODO

- Make a release version 
- Clean up variable names
- Test the script with other printers (currently only tested on Ender3 with custom firmware).
- Create a GitHub build workflow for automated builds.

Feel free to contribute to this project by submitting pull requests or reporting any issues you encounter. Your contributions are greatly appreciated!


## Configuration

To configure the script, you can modify the following settings:

- `Folder_name`: The name of the folder where the print files are stored on the SD card. Change this according to your preference.
